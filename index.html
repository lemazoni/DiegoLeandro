        <p>JavaScript has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>

        <p>Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace</p>

        <p>It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.</p>
